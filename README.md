# Astro + React Example

This repo is used in my blog post, [<INSERT POST TITLE>](#). The code is largely based on the [Astro + React starter template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/framework-react), which can be generated by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template framework-react
```

I made the following changes on top of the starter template:

- Added a GitHub Action to automatically update package dependency versions.
- Added a simple test suite to demonstrate how you can run tests from the GitHub Action.
